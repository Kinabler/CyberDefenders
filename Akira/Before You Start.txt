Important Notes:
-----------------
- It's recommended to use EvtxECmd to parse logs extracted from memory and then load them into Timeline Explorer for improved visibility and more efficient log analysis.
- To properly use ELEX (Event Log Explorer), you can drag and drop event log files directly into the application, as the free version does not include the explorer feature.
